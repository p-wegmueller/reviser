\title{Extract the Nth Data Release (Vintage)}
\usage{
get_nth_release(df, n = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing data vintages. The data frame must include the columns
\code{pub_date} (publication date of the release) and \code{time} (the corresponding time period for the data).}

\item{n}{The release number to extract. Accepts:
- A non-negative integer or vector (e.g., 0 for the first release, 1 for the second, etc.).
- \code{"first"} to extract the first release.
- \code{"latest"} to extract the most recent release.
Default is 0 (the first release).}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame containing only the specified release(s). The resulting data frame is
assigned the class \code{tbl_nth_rel} to indicate its structure.
}
\description{
Filters the input dataset to return the Nth release (or vintage) of data for each time period.
The function supports selecting the first, latest, or a specific numbered release (starting from 0).
}
\details{
The behavior depends on the value of \code{n}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Non-negative integer}: The function retrieves the Nth release for each time period. Note that the release
indexing starts at 0 (e.g., 0 = first release, 1 = second release, etc.).
\item \strong{"first"}: Retrieves the first release for each time period (via \code{get_first_release}).
\item \strong{"latest"}: Retrieves the most recent release for each time period (via \code{get_latest_release}).
}
}
\examples{
# Example data
df <- reviser::gdp

# Get the first release (n = 0)
first_release <- get_nth_release(df, n = 0)

# Get the latest release
latest_release <- get_nth_release(df, n = "latest")

# Get the second release (n = 1)
second_release <- get_nth_release(df, n = 1)

}
