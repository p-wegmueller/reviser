\title{Calculate the Number of Days Between Period End and First Release}
\usage{
get_days_to_release(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing data vintages. The data frame must
include the columns \code{pub_date} (publication date of the release) and
\code{time} (the corresponding time period for the data).}
}
\value{
A data frame with an additional column \code{days_to_release}
representing the number of days between the publication date (\code{pub_date})
and the time period (\code{time}) for each release.
}
\description{
Computes the number of days between the publication date (\code{pub_date}) of a
release and the time period  (\code{time}) end date for each record in
the dataset.
}
\details{
The function calculates the difference between \code{pub_date} and \code{time}
for each row in the dataset. The result is expressed as the number of days
between the release publication date and the corresponding time period end.
If the dataset is in wide format, it will first be transformed into long
format using \code{vintages_long}.
}
\examples{
# Example data
df <- dplyr::filter(reviser::gdp, id=="US")

# Calculate days to release
df_with_days <- get_days_to_release(df)
